Author: Alex Marvin

Introduction
------------

This program allows one to use the Pomodoro techique on the command line.
The Pomodoro technique is a productivity technique in which you work for
25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. Then you work for another 25
minutes. Each 25 minute period is known as a Pomodoro. You repeat as many
times as necessary. After 4 Pomodoros, you take a longer break.

Running
-------
To run:

    tomato

A bar will show up at the top. Press `s` to start the timer. Depending on the message, 
it will start the break or work timer.

To stop the program, simply press `CTRL+C`

Installation
------------
Make sure that the prequisites below are installed before installation.

Run `make` in the **tomato** directory to compile the code.

Then run

`keyword = 5`
* keyword is either *worktime*, *breaktime*, or *longbreak*
* "5" is the number of minutes
